## Description
Group chat app with end-to-end encryption using MLS (Messaging-Layer Security) Protocol

## Functionality (TODO):
- sending encrypted instant messages in a group chat
- viewing messages with minimal delay, and viewing chat history
- adding and removing members from the group chat
- (forward security) new users/unauthorised attackers can’t see previous messages
- (post-compromise security) removed users/unauthorised attackers can’t see new messages
